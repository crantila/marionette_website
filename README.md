# Marionette Website

Cut down version of the Marionette.js website.


## What Is This Repository?

This is a modified copy of the MarionetteJS website (available at https://github.com/marionettejs/marionettejs.com).

This repository contains the compiled files that used to be served at https://marionettejs.com, but without some
of the third-party code (e.g., Google Analytics) and with only the versions I care about for work (3.5 and 4.1).


## Why Does This Repository Exist?

In September 2023, the MarionetteJS domain name expired, and (as far as I know) it has yet to be made available
anywhere else. Even though MarionetteJS is obviously abandoned, and horribly out-of-fashion, I still use it at
work every day. And sometimes I even want to read the documentation! I made this repository to help with that.


## How to Use This Site (Local)

You can view the website (and therefore the Marionette documentation) locally with a command like this:

`python3 -m http.server 8000`

And then open a browser to http://localhost:8000 to view the site.


## How to Use This Site (Online)

You can also view this website online: https://marionettejs.netlify.app/docs/current/
